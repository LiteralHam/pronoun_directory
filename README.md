# pronoun_directory
WIP Allow a group of users to store, edit, and search for the preferred pronouns of any user like they might look up an email address in a school directory.  
Allows for multiple sets of pronouns, custom pronouns, and uses pronouns in a sentence so user can make sure they are correct. This is a WIP because I'm still learning Python so I'll probably make major changes to how it is organized
